* What is a pull request?

- A pull request is a way to propose changes to a codebase and request a review and a merge from other developers.
- A pull request is created when a developer has completed a feature on a branch of a repository and wants to merge it into the main branch.
- A pull request is a thing that GitHub, or Bitbucket, or some other web hosting service, provides.
- It is not part of Git itself.
- Although it cannot be achieved from a random CLI, GitHub has an officially released solution for creating pull requests from the command line: the GitHub CLI.

* What is a fork?

- In Github, a fork refers to a personal copy of another user’s repository.
- When forking a repository, one creates an independent copy that exists within the individual's own account or organization.
- This copy includes all the files, commit history, and branches present in the original repository at the time of forking.
- Essentially, forking allows an individual to make modifications to the codebase without affecting the original project.
- One can then submit a pull request to the original repository to propose merging the changes back into it or keep the forked version for the individual's own use.
- It’s a way to collaborate, experiment, and contribute to open-source projects while maintaining separation from the original codebase.
- A fork is a thing that Github provides.
- It is not part of Git itself.
- Although it cannot be achieved from a random CLI, GitHub has an officially released solution for forking a repository from the command line: the GitHub CLI.

* What are GitHub Issues?

- GitHub Issues helps developers track bugs, enhancements, and tasks, ensuring that projects stay organized and on track.
- GitHub Issues are a way to track and manage the work needed to improve the projects.
- Each issue can represent a task, bug report, or feature request and can be assigned to team members, tagged with labels, and linked to milestones.
- There is also an issue dashboard that lists all issues from all the projects an individual has been working on.

* What is the .gitignore file?

- .gitignore file is used in a git repository to ignore the files and directories which are unnecessary to the project.
- These files and directories will be ignored by git once the changes has been committed to the remote repository.
- The type of files which will get ignored are mainly temporary files and the files which should not be versioned.

* What is rebase in Git?

- Rebase is a way to integrate changes from one branch into another.
- Merge creates a new commit to combine the commits of both branches.
- Rebase moves the commits from one branch to another, generally sub-branch to main branch, creating a linear history.

* What is stash in Git?

- Stash temporarily shelves changes made to the working copy so that one can work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them later on.
- Stashing is handy if one needs to quickly switch context and work on something else, but is mid-way through a code change and aren't quite ready to commit.
